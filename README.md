# Hang In There

A font of inspiration!

Hang In There is a resource to create, save, and display motivational posters using three component elements:
- An inspirational image
- A title derived from a motivational virtue
- A tried and true quote of homespun wisdom

Instructions For Use:
1. On load, the page will display a fully realized poster composed of randomized elements from our arrays.
2. Users have the option to save the current poster, move to the saved posters view, show another randomized poster, or create their own!
3. Upon choosing the "Make Your Own Poster" button, the user is taken to a set of input fields where they can enter their own image, title, and quote! Upon pressing the "Show my poster" button, the user will find their new poster displayed and as an added bonus, the elements they have contributed, will be used in future randomized posters.
4. Whatever poster is currently displayed, can be saved with the "Save This Poster" button and accessed with the "Show Saved Posters" button which brings up the saved posters view.
5. While in saved posters view, any poster can be deleted with a simple double-click.

We the designers, hope that this resource will give the user as much pleasure in use as it was to create!
